More on Selenium
To get starterd create a driver: driver = webdriver.Chrome()
Chrome driver is not the only driver you can create an object of You can also create driver for safari, mozilla firefox etc.
by using the .get() method you can visit a website

If chrome options are not set up using add experimental options(chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions, then chrome_options.add_experimental_options("detach", True) then the browser will fade after opening, be sure to configure these options and pass them into the driver object as argument.

driver.close() - Closes a tab in the browser
driver.quit() - Shuts down the entire window(Prefered method)

We can search once we have opened the browser for elements or tags using selenium
The By class is important, You can import it by writing import from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
We can use this by applying the dot notation, By.CLASS_NAME, BY.ID, BY.NAME and BY_CSS_SELECTOR BY.XPATH(This method right here will always work) etc

The above returns selenium element, we can tap into different things using dot notation

The find_elements will get using the same selectors but will find everything in screen that matches that and return it as a list

To click on the screen use the method .click()

Finding links by using the Link-text selector, you have to provide the test then you will get hold of it, eg  driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, value=126,675)
This link we can do all that we want with it use .click() to open it etc.

To get hold of input fields normally By.NAME is used and  we can after getting hold of it make use of .send_keys to send what you want to search to the browser. 

from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import keys

This helps us to press the enter keyword, it basically just gives us access to all keys in the keyboard, Shift, tab etc
